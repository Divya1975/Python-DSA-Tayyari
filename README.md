# Python-DSA-Tayyari
🚀 This repository is a part of my personal DSA journey using Python.  
Each folder contains notes, code examples, and practice problems for one DSA topic.  
I'm building this step-by-step while learning from real courses and challenges.

🔍 Topics covered:
- Python Basics
- Data Types
- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
- Strings
- List Comprehension
- Recursion
... and more coming soon!

📘 **Next Topics Coming Soon (Core DSA Section):**
I'm currently learning the basics of Python for DSA.  
Once I complete that, I'll start adding core DSA topics with problems & solutions:

🔜 Planned Topics:
- Arrays
- Searching Algorithms (Linear, Binary Search)
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Merge Sort, etc.)
- Stack & Queue
- Linked List
- Recursion (Advanced)
- Hashing
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming (DP)

Stay tuned for more updates! 🚧

📂 10_Dictionaries
├── notes.md
├── dictionaries.py
└── dictionaries_practice.py

📂 13_Functions
├── notes.md
├── functions.py
└── functions_practice.py

📂 14_Recursion
├── notes.md
├── recursion.py
└── recursion_practice.py

... and so on for each topic.

➡️ You can explore any topic folder to find:
- `notes.md` → My notes with key points
- `xyz.py` → Concept explanations
- `xyz_practice.py` → Coding practice problems
