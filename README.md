# Python-DSA-Tayyari
🚀 This repository is a part of my personal DSA journey using Python.  
Each folder contains notes, code examples, and practice problems for one DSA topic.  
I'm building this step-by-step while learning from real courses and challenges.

🔍 Topics covered:
- Python Basics
- Data Types
- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
- Strings
- List Comprehension
- Recursion
... and more coming soon!
